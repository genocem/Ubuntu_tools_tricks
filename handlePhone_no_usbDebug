Main tool is scrcpy to install search it then go to its github and follow how to install
do not use the apt version cause it's old and doesn't have --otg which is our main focus

  tldr:
	git clone https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy
 	cd scrcpy/
	./install_release.sh

scrcpy can be used to mirror phone screen if usb debugging is on and it can also be used to control the phone in case the touch screen doesn't work

to control the phone you simply plug it in (this might sound stupid but some cables are so bad that you need to plug them slowly for them to be able to send data)

use this command: scrcpy --otg 

this will search and connect to available devices that can be controlled through usb as if you're plugging in actual keyboard+mouse

	if your phone doesn't connect immediately after entering the "scrcpy --otg" command and you get an output of serials, just copy the serial of your phone

	then enter this command:

	sudo scrcpy --otg -s <serial here>

then put your mouse inside the new little window that popped up 

from there if the password is text based or a pin you can use keyboad (some phones need you to press enter after entering pin code) otherwise use mouse

once you go in (i tested this in 2 samsung galaxy phones) you will be immediately prompted if you want to share data with connected device so press tab 2 times and hit enter and the device will begin sharing data with the computer

you can navigate through most elements using tab
