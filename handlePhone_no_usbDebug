Main tool is scrcpy to install search it then go to its github and follow how to install
do not use the apt version cause it's old and doesn't have --otg 

  tldr:
	git clone https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy
 	cd scrcpy/
	./install_release.sh

scrcpy can be used to mirror phone screen if usb debugging is on

if not you can use scrcpy --otg 
this will show available devices that can be controlled through usb where you can control them as if you're plugging actual keyboard+mouse

to use just get the serial of the device that you intend to control then type

sudo scrcpy --otg -s <serial here>

from there if the password is text based or a pin you can use keyboad (some phones need you to press enter after entering pin code)

once you go in (i tested this in just one phone but) most of the time in samsung phones you will be immediately prompted if you want to share data with connected device (i forgot if you can just hit enter to accept or if you need to press tab first but if that works congrats you can get your data back) 

you can navigate through most elements using tab 

in samsung phones, bringing the top bar using the mouse makes makes the first option the settings app so you can immediately press enter
