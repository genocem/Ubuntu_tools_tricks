go to this file

sudo gedit /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/analog-output.conf.common


before 
[Element PCM]
switch = mute
volume = merge
override-map.1 = all
override-map.2 = all-left,all-right

you should add :

[Element Master]
switch = mute
volume = merge



so it'll look like this:

[Element Master]
switch = mute
volume = merge


[Element PCM]
switch = mute
volume = merge
override-map.1 = all
override-map.2 = all-left,all-right




this one idk why i added it but it's under the other 2 so maybe add it maybe not:

[Element LFE]
switch = mute
volume = ignore
