for exec and icon add the path for either one
example for icon:
	/home/ahmed/installations/eclipse-java-2023-06-R-linux-gtk-x86_64/eclipse/icon.xpm

go to the directory icons directory using: cd /usr/share/applications
(you can also make the shortcut in your desktop "~/Desktop")

simply sudo gedit name.desktop


if you're not sudo :
	in a sudo account use this command:
		sudo gpasswd -a “username” sudo


paste this config and change accordingly:

[Desktop Entry]
Name=Mathlab
Type=Application
Exec=change
Icon=change
Terminal=false (some programs need this to be "étrue" such as matlab)



extra options
[Desktop Entry]
Comment=Mathlab useless
Keywords=Mathlab;mathlab;m; helps in search maybe
StartupNotify=true
