- install both of these extentions:
		Synthwave x Fluoromachine & epic animations (it has preview tag on the top)
		Custom CSS and JS Loader


- if you're a linux user you need to be owner:
	sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/share/code


- now in vscode open ctrl+shift+p and search "preference: open user settings (JSON)"
and these lines based on your os (i'm just copy pasting the description of the synthwave extention and adding linux example to it) :

On Mac it might look something like the snippet below:


  "vscode_custom_css.imports": [
    "file:///Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/thecodemonkey.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-epic-animations-1.4.13/synthwave-x-fluoromachine.css",
    "file:///Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/thecodemonkey.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-epic-animations-1.4.13/epic-80s-transitions.css"
    ]
    ,


Windows might resemble:


  "vscode_custom_css.imports": [
    "file:///C:/Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/thecodemonkey.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-epic-animations-1.4.13/synthwave-x-fluoromachine.css",
    "file:///C:/Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/thecodemonkey.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-epic-animations-1.4.13/epic-80s-transitions.css"
    ]
    ,


in linux:
        "vscode_custom_css.imports": [
          "file:/home/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/thecodemonkey.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-epic-animations-1.4.13/synthwave-x-fluoromachine.css",
          "file:/home/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/thecodemonkey.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-epic-animations-1.4.13/epic-80s-transitions.css"
          ]
      ,


finally open ctrl+shift+p and search "enable custom css and js" you should get prompted to reload vscode so do so

 
and that's it !

btw there might be a pop up that says that the vscode installation is corrupted or something 
ignore it 



to undo:
	get rid of what you added to the settings file 
	use the reload feature of the custom css and js extention to reload vscode theme 
	uninstall both extentions
