save uml work as svg then open the svg file in a browser and open the console

firefox asked to type this for security: allow pasting 

then you can paste this:

document.querySelectorAll("text").forEach(e => e.innerHTML = e.innerHTML === "UNREGISTERED"? "":e.innerHTML) 


then save the page

if you don't want svg just search for svg to png on google (or jpeg if you're into that)
